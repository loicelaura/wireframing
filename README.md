# wireframing
Wireframing is the process of creating a low-fidelity, skeletal, and schematic visual representation of a website, application, or digital product. 

Importance in the Design Process
 Focus on Functionality and Content First.
 Early Problem Detection and Iteration.
 Cost-Effective.
 Clear Communication.
 User Feedback and Testing.
 Defines Information Hierarchy.
 Foundation for Visual Design.
 Faster Development.

 key elements found in a wireframe

1. Layout Structure
   This element determines the visual hierarchy and flow of information. It defines the main areas like headers, footers, sidebars, main content areas, and how these areas are proportioned and spaced on the screen. It doesn't specify colors or fonts, but rather the boxes where these will eventually reside.On an e-commerce product page wireframe, the layout structure might dictate a large image gallery on the left, product title and price prominently at the top-right, followed by a "Add to Cart" button, and then detailed specifications below the fold, with a small related products section at the bottom. This structure ensures key purchasing information is immediately visible.

   2. Navigation
  This element encompasses menus, links, buttons (that lead to other pages), search bars, breadcrumbs, pagination, and any other interactive components that direct users from one point to another within the product. Its primary goal is to make the user journey intuitive and efficient.A wireframe for a news website would clearly show a main horizontal navigation bar at the top with categories like "Politics," "Sports," "Technology," "Culture." Below that, a search icon. On an article page, breadcrumbs ("Home > Technology > [Article Title]") would be shown, alongside "Next Article" and "Previous Article" links, all contributing to effortless content discovery.

3. Content Placement
Unlike layout, which is about the large blocks, content placement specifies within those blocks where headlines, paragraphs, images, videos, user-generated content, etc., will be situated. Wireframes often use placeholders (e.g., "Image Placeholder," "Lorem Ipsum" text blocks) to represent actual content.In a blog post wireframe, the content placement would show a large rectangle for the featured image at the top, followed by a text block for the headline, a smaller text block for the author and date, and then long text blocks for the main article body.

4. Functionality
   This element includes interactive components like buttons (e.g., "Submit," "Add to Cart"), forms (input fields, dropdowns), sliders, toggles, search fields, interactive maps, video players, and hover effects. It focuses on the actions available to the user and the expected system response.A wireframe for an online banking portal might include input fields for "Username" and "Password" with a "Login" button, a "Forgot Password?" link, and a checkbox for "Remember Me." Once logged in, it would show buttons for "Transfer Funds," "Pay Bills," and "View Statements," clearly outlining the core actions users can perform.
